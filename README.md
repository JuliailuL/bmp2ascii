# bmp2ascii 
A small C program that converts BMP images into ASCII art displayed in the terminal.
 
## Features
- Converts 24-bit BMP files to ASCII art
- Uses gamma correction for perceptual brightness adjustment
- Aspect ratio aware (each pixel is printed as two characters wide) 
- Supports simple and dense ASCII ramps (easily switchable)
- Includes automated test examples with sample BMP files
 
## Usage
```
make
./conv path/to/image.bmp
```
 
### Example:
```
./conv examples/snail.bmp
```
 
## ASCII Ramps
You can experiment with different ramps by editing the ART constant in ascii.c:
```
const char *ART = "@%#*+=-:. ";  // Less detailed
// const char *ART = " .'`^\",:;Il!i><~+_-?][}{1)(|\\/*tfjrxnuvczXYUJCLQ0OZmwqpdbkhao*#MW&8%B@$"; // Detailed
```

```
cd examples
./run_tests.sh
```
